- Improved: Loader startup performance through re-introducing ReadyToRun.  
- Improved: Launcher RAM usage after startup.  Reloaded Launcher should have a working set of <100MB during normal use now.  
- Improved: Linux (Wine) support to give more useful, clear and up to date information on process launch.  
- Improved: Reduced the number of DLLs in Loader output to improve performance when booting after a fresh Windows reboot.

- Fixed: Hiding exit button in dialogue boxes will no longer hide exit button in main window.

- Changed: *Reloaded Process Menu* (click on process in processes list) now displays user friendly Mod Name instead of Mod Id.
