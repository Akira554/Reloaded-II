## Changelog (1.25.8)

- Downloading a mod in App now automatically downloads dependencies.

Reported by @AnimatedSwine37 , it was previously possible for the user to edit a mod they just downloaded,
causing missing dependencies to be dropped. 

Although auto-downloading dependencies is not a fool-proof fix, it is a sufficiently good workaround for
the time being. 

Some very edge cases may still exist of course, such as user's internet connection may drop while 
downloading dependencies, and then the user edits the mod via dialog. 

More fixes for these edge cases may ship in future, but for now, this is being hot-patched, 
i.e. this bug was reported less than 1 hour ago, and there's already a released patch to work around it.

## Changelog (1.25.7)
- No more 'Rate Limited' by GitHub fail on `Setup.exe`.

## Changelog (1.25.6)
- Made error for GitHub rate limiting in Setup friendlier.

## Changelog (1.25.5)
- Fixed an oversight where empty working directory was not defaulting to EXE folder.
