## Introduction
**[Reloaded II]** is a Universal DLL Injection based Mod Loader and Management System.

Designed mostly for hacking games, it is a completely free and open source public rewrite of **[Reloaded]**, my original first fully fledged mod loader.

Made from the ground up **proudly** using the C# programming language.
