If the mod download doesn't contain a directory in the zip/7z/rar file, create a new folder yourself.

## Enable Mod and Launch Application
From there, simply enter the `Application Menu`, enable the mod and launch the application.

### Note
Reloaded uses `.exe` name to determine which mods should automatically be assigned to an application.

If a mod does not show in the application, click the 3 gear button (`Manage Mods`).
From there, select the mod that you have just extracted from the list and check your game on the list below.
